# brain_tumor_classification
The Brain Tumor Classification is a machine learning project that classifies 2D brain scan images as tumorous or not using the Brain MRI Images dataset from kaggle. The model predicts results based on a variety of MRI scans using a 2D Convolutional Neural Network. The model was built using Tensorflow.
